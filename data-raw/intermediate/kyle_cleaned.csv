sexual assault in the one semester he spent in college (at one of the most ultra conservative college in America) before dropping out due to having straight Ds (his own admission), he was accused of sexual assault by a dozen women, in a letter signed by over 150 former classmates who corroborated the victim’s accounts, which represents almost 50% of the entire student body of Patrick Henry College.

**sexual assault** in the one semester he spent in college (at one of the most ultra conservative college in America) before dropping out due to having straight Ds (his own admission), he was accused of sexual assault by a dozen women, in a letter signed by over 150 former classmates who corroborated the victim’s accounts, which represents almost 50% of the entire student body of Patrick Henry College.

**white supremacy** he accused a political opponent of “leaving his career in Boston to go work for non-whites”. Like, he wrote that, on his website, as an insult. As a way to discredit someone. He later said the words were “taken out of context” and it was a “syntax error”.

>In August 2020, during Cawthorn's campaign for Congress, several women came forward accusing him of sexually aggressive behavior, sexual misconduct, and sexual assault. Katrina Krulikas described an incident when she was 17 and Cawthorn was 19 in which Cawthorn pressured her to sit on his lap and attempted to kiss her forcefully twice, which she resisted. Cawthorn did not deny the allegations, but said, ""I did try and kiss her, just very normal, just in a flirtatious way"", adding, ""If I did make her feel unsafe, I feel bad"", but questioned the timing of her allegation. His campaign characterized Krulikas's allegations as politically motivated, which she denied.

And it just gets worse

>After Krulikas made her allegations, three other women made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cawthorn, including forcible grabbing and kissing. One woman said Cawthorn called her ""just a little blonde, slutty American girl"" when she rejected his sexual advances.

And worse

>A February 2021 BuzzFeed News investigation found 20 people who said that Cawthorn had harassed his female classmates during college; the reporters spoke to four women who said that Cawthorn had harassed them. It was alleged that Cawthorn often recklessly drove women in his car to remote areas off campus while asking them sexual questions, which he called ""fun drives"". Two resident assistants said they warned women to avoid Cawthorn and not to ride in his car. A male acquaintance said Cawthorn bragged about pulling a woman into his lap and putting a finger between her legs.

About a week in we were discussing ethics and one of the cases we had was a question about a woman who was a manager at a construction site. She was new and found out the company was getting kickbacks. (There’s more, but that’s the gist of it.)

The female (there’s a reason why I say this) teacher asked us what should she do.

This classmate raises his hand and says:

“She should realize that she’s way over her head and is too weak for the position. She then should quit and go back to the kitchen where she belongs after giving her job to a man.”

There was some awkward laughter and the teacher commented that was an interesting view before moving on.

Every single time after that when he had a chance he heckled her, disrupting the class, making rude comments just loud enough for her to hear and at one point insulted her outright about an exercise about commercials asking how we were supposed to know them when we were much younger than she was.

She lost her temper at that point (first time), and told him to finish the exercise or leave. He finished (still complaining loudly about how stupid the exercise was and how he didn’t know the ads because he wasn’t old like her.

Dunno whatever happened to the kid, I think she pulled him aside after that class and told him point blank she was failing him and stop coming to class.

They've got energy to spare and use it in the best way they can in a system that has shifted to make things hard for them.  There are exceptions, Cawthorne for example.  As for Gen Z, I'm waiting to form an opinion as I'm not sure about their traits yet.  But I like what I see.  From my perspective, I would love to see the America Millennials and Z's create, but the rot has got to get out of the way."

But I refuse to let them co-opt Anarchist as well, so I please bear with me while I give a short lesson on the Greek language.

Anarchist comes from Greek, as a combination of the ""An"" prefix, and the ""Archos"" root. Everyone knows ""An-"" means without, no trouble there. ""Archos"", though, is often translated as just ""Rule"". Here in English (and I imagine other languages of similar root) This single-word gloss is quite problematic, as there at least two different meanings this word can take, and the one that's often implied is not quite correct. The Greek root, ""Archos"", does indeed mean ""Rule"", but in the sense of ""Rule over"", or ""Subjugate"", and is also the root of the word ""Hierarchy"". Anarchy, in its original sense, and the way 99% of self-identifying anarchists of any repute today and historically usethe term, is better glossed as ""Without rulers, without (human) hierarchy, the abolition of all forms of oppression and subjugation"". The incorrect interpretation, which no doubt has been intentionally pushed by over a century of anti-anarchist activity, often by those towards the top of the hierarchies that anarchists wish to abolish, would suggest that Anarchists are against rules, against all forms of laws and social norms. It hapens, though, that there is another Greek word for these sense of the word, and it is not ""Archos"" but ""Nomos"". And there is indeed a word ""Anomie"", that better reflects this sense of the word.

I don't really expect many to adopt the term for this usage, but I at least want people to be aware that there are some for whom the term ""Anarchist"" does not mean the same sense as it is used in casual conversation, and that includes a vast majority of those who identify with the term.",False,t1_hlg7xql,/r/politics/comments/qydxba/cawthorn_praises_rittenhouse_verdict_tells/hlgc2r7/,"I can't really blame anyone for this, as the word ""anarchist"" has been the target of tons of propaganda and disinformation campaigns, stretching back to the 1st red scare in the early 20th century, and going back even further to the 19th century, when French anarchists even coined and adopted the term ""Libertarian"" to get away from the baggage, although this term itself got co-opted and hijacked by the right wing in America in the mid 20th century and rest of the world recently.

Putting aside coronavirus and looking only at political instability/regression, there was the Post-9/11 madness, the horrifyingly damaging Reagan years, the tumultuous and corrupt Nixon years, the Civil Rights era, the Great Depression along with the Business Plot, the massacres and bombings at the start of the labor movement, the Gilded Age before that, reconstruction, the Civil War… I could go on, but I think you get the idea.    Yes, it is very bad. Certainly as bad as it’s been in most people’s lifetimes. But not unprecedentedly bad. The thing is, it’s a very lopsided kind of bad. Things were holistically worse in, say, the Reagan years, but the badness wasn’t nearly so concentrated in just one political movement, nor was it on nearly so worrying a trajectory."

The first man shot by Kyle Rittenhouse on the streets of Kenosha was “hyperaggressive” that night, threatened to kill Rittenhouse and later lunged for his rifle just before the 17-year-old fired, witnesses testified Thursday.

Richie McGinniss, who was recording events on a cellphone that night for the conservative website The Daily Caller, testified that Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man shot that night, was killed after chasing down Rittenhouse and making a lunge for the gun.

“I think it was very clear to me that he was reaching specifically for the weapon,” McGinniss said.

Ryan Balch, a former Army infantryman who carried an AR-style rifle that night and walked around patrolling the streets with Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum was “hyperaggressive and acting out in a violent manner,” including trying to set fires and throwing rocks.

Balch said he got between Rosenbaum and another man while Rosenbaum was trying to start a fire, and Rosenbaum got angry, shouting, “If I catch any of you guys alone tonight I’m going to f—- kill you!”

BTW the supreme court ruling (I believe, and I could be wrong) was about them not having a duty to act / protect people in a state where there was no law requiring such a thing.

>Balch is a bit of a whackadoo, and I seriously doubt there was a large, coordinated effort between the two groups, even though they were friendly and may have made eachother aware of their movements.

we are in the age of uncoordinated coordination. I wish there was a single word to properly describe it. Police and right wing groups don't have to explicitly work together to actually work together. They understand each others actions and reactions, they also broadcast their plans. So right wingers broadcast they plan on doing xyz, then all of a sudden police broadcast they plan on doing efg.

Same with campaigns and superpacs / the media. Put out a statement, that becomes the talking point without actually communicating directly.

Their ideas aren't dying they are transforming this country into an authoritarian state that will look remarkably like a technological apartheid control state. They currently hold roughly 30-35% of the public sentiment, but almost complete control of our government at all levels from municipal to federal. If you believe that they don't have control, when they sit in power they pass all of their budgets. When the opposition sits in power, the government is paralyzed to do anything.

Corrupt DA's put black men in prison for reefer, cops were rewarded for corruption, a new drug boom.   20 people died in the 2020 unrest.   Riots kill people, fires kill people unintentionally, the only form of defence against riots is a united community and firearms. I would add police but police were useless in Kenosha or Portland and enhance the problems.   Coffee got off for shooting at cops who broke into his house and killed his girlfriend, he is black, he is not guilty of any wrongdoings. Just a small example of progress.   "

Funny of you to say that, because we ***just*** had a case where something like that happened.

>Dangerous is a very connoted word which denotes aggression, assault and attack not protection and defensiveness.

Given the Rittenhouse incident, it turns out that right wing folks being ""dangerous"" is actually just them being prepared for self defense. It's actually the left wing pedophiles/felons that go out in the streets looking to attack/assault/shoot children.

Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of those murders.

In the state of Wisconsin, it says [clear as day, right here,](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/948/60) that if you're under the age of 18 and you possess a firearm, loaded or unloaded, outside of the context of target shooting or the armed forces, you are guilty of a Class A Misdemeanor. It also says the person that bought the firearm is guilty of a felony if anyone comes of any sort of bodily harm as a result.

None of this is in the scope of the trial. Nor the fact that he traveled with it. That's fucking kangaroo court. 


The judge had a Trump rally rendition of ""God Bless the USA"" ringtone go off in *court* for Christ sake. Are you kidding me? 

I'll even put the statute right here for you: 

    *948.60  Possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.
    (1)  In this section, “dangerous weapon"" means any firearm, loaded or unloaded; any electric weapon, as defined in s. 941.295 (1c) (a); metallic knuckles or knuckles of any substance which could be put to the same use with the same or similar effect as metallic knuckles; a nunchaku or any similar weapon consisting of 2 sticks of wood, plastic or metal connected at one end by a length of rope, chain, wire or leather; a cestus or similar material weighted with metal or other substance and worn on the hand; a shuriken or any similar pointed star-like object intended to injure a person when thrown; or a manrikigusari or similar length of chain having weighted ends.
    (2) 
    (a) Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
    (b) Except as provided in par. (c), any person who intentionally sells, loans or gives a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age is guilty of a Class I felony.
    (c) Whoever violates par. (b) is guilty of a Class H felony if the person under 18 years of age under par. (b) discharges the firearm and the discharge causes death to himself, herself or another.
    (d) A person under 17 years of age who has violated this subsection is subject to the provisions of ch. 938 unless jurisdiction is waived under s. 938.18 or the person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of criminal jurisdiction under s. 938.183.
    (3) 
    (a) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon is being used in target practice under the supervision of an adult or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the supervision of an adult. This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.
    (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty. This section does not apply to an adult who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age in the line of duty.
    (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28.
    History: 1987 a. 332; 1991 a. 18, 139; 1993 a. 98; 1995 a. 27, 77; 1997 a. 248; 2001 a. 109; 2005 a. 163; 2011 a. 35.
    Sub. (2) (b) does not set a standard for civil liability, and a violation of sub. (2) (b) does not constitute negligence per se. Logarto v. Gustafson, 998 F. Supp. 998 (1998).*

I'll even put the statute right here for you: 948.60  Possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.     (1)  In this section, “dangerous weapon"" means any firearm, loaded or unloaded; any electric weapon, as defined in s. 941.295 (1c) (a); metallic knuckles or knuckles of any substance which could be put to the same use with the same or similar effect as metallic knuckles; a nunchaku or any similar weapon consisting of 2 sticks of wood, plastic or metal connected at one end by a length of rope, chain, wire or leather; a cestus or similar material weighted with metal or other substance and worn on the hand; a shuriken or any similar pointed star-like object intended to injure a person when thrown; or a manrikigusari or similar length of chain having weighted ends.     (2)      (a) Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.     (b) Except as provided in par. (c), any person who intentionally sells, loans or gives a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age is guilty of a Class I felony.     (c) Whoever violates par. (b) is guilty of a Class H felony if the person under 18 years of age under par. (b) discharges the firearm and the discharge causes death to himself, herself or another.     (d) A person under 17 years of age who has violated this subsection is subject to the provisions of ch. 938 unless jurisdiction is waived under s. 938.18 or the person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of criminal jurisdiction under s. 938.183.     (3)      (a) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon is being used in target practice under the supervision of an adult or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the supervision of an adult. This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.     (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty. This section does not apply to an adult who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age in the line of duty.     (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28.     History: 1987 a. 332; 1991 a. 18, 139; 1993 a. 98; 1995 a. 27, 77; 1997 a. 248; 2001 a. 109; 2005 a. 163; 2011 a. 35.     Sub. (2) (b) does not set a standard for civil liability, and a violation of sub. (2) (b) does not constitute negligence per se. Logarto v. Gustafson, 998 F. Supp. 998 (1998). EDIT:  I read up on this. The whole section only applies if the weapon, in this context meaning ""any firearm"" falls into some extremely narrow guidelines. This gun technically did not, and is why his weapons charge got thrown out. That's clever."

By way of being an immediate response to a discussion of his moral character, very much appears to be insinuating that the first death having been a rapist is a defence of his moral character, which is the subject of the thread.

If people want to discuss the moral character of the rapist, whatever, it's just not really relevant to Rittenhouse, though.

The executioner comment seems to be a response to the number of people who use the rape as justification for the death; in that context, if you think it's okay for Rittenhouse to kill someone _because they're a rapist_, you're absolutely encouraging extrajudicial execution; but that's not your stance, I assume.

Cool.

Meanwhile, you're complaining about him ""probably but not directly calling for violence"" while the other half of the political spectrum is *actually* out in the streets committing violence and attacking children.

>Well it is indeed a feeling that you have and not a fact as only a handful of people have been killed in left wing attacks against hundreds for right wing attacks. Sorry but 'facts don't Care about your feelings'

Neat. I thought we were talking about recent events (hence the article/link to the politicians statements?). Talking about recent attacks by ""the left"" is off topic, but talking about old events isn't?

>But that doesn't mean he isn't inciting violence just like Trump cannot be held legally liable because he said 'Stand back and stand by' to the prood boys or when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol but that doesn't mean the subsequents violence and attacks are not a consequence or at least strongly related to it

More of the ""but they'll ***probably*** go out and commit violent acts"", while ignoring that the other side of the political spectrum are the ones ***currently*** out committing violent acts. When they cross the line, feel free to prosecute them on it, I'll lose no sleep. It's just weird as fuck for you to be accusing someone of ""maybe"" doing something, while actively blocking your eyes from seeing that others are *currently* doing that thing.

The ""left wing"" currently controls our government, so if they had issues with crime/criminality they'd be capable of changing those laws.

Meanwhile, you're complaining about him ""probably but not directly calling for violence"" while the other half of the political spectrum is actually out in the streets committing violence and attacking children.

So it turns out that the judge may have had a different issue with the statute than I initially thought. He might have believed that it was a useless statute due to a second statute referenced within it.

[Here's the statute Rittenhouse was charged under](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/948/60). It deals with dangerous weapons and how/when people under 18 can have them. Section 1 defines what a dangerous weapon is. For the purpose of Rittenhouse, it's literally the first thing listed.

> In this section, “dangerous weapon"" means any firearm, loaded or unloaded;

So, we can confirm he has a dangerous weapon, nice. Okay, let's look at it more. Section 2 has the two following parts that apply to Rittenhouse.

> (a) Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor 

> (b) Except as provided in par. (c), any person who intentionally sells, loans or gives a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age is guilty of a Class I felony.

Okay, so, Rittenhouse was under 18 when the thing happened, that should make (a) apply to him and (b) apply to his friend who provided him with the gun (his friend is being charged for this). Parts c and d don't apply to Rittenhouse, so we can move on to section 3 which deals with exceptions. To summarize this section, part (a) talks about target practice and instruction in the safe use of dangerous weapons as part of a course. This doesn't apply to Rittenhouse. Part (b) talks about the armed forces and/or national guard, which doesn't apply to Rittenhouse. Part (c) is where things get messy and may apply to Rittenhouse.

> This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28.

Now, we have to go a bit further and determine what the hell these other statutes are. [941.28](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/941/iii/28) is what the defense argued exempts Rittenhouse. Now, the problem here is that it more or less invalidates sections 1 (a) and 2 (a). Because 941.28 defines what a short-barreled rifle or short-barreled shotgun are. So this implies that long rifles aren't a dangerous weapon, which is absolutely asinine given that they're literally what we used to fight two World Wars. But here we go for the definition that the judge used to dismiss the charge:

>  “Short-barreled rifle"" means a rifle having one or more barrels having a length of less than 16 inches measured from closed breech or bolt face to muzzle or a rifle having an overall length of less than 26 inches.

Plenty of demcorats and republicans are simply not doing that and even trying to defuse the situation (see McCain's response to one of his supporter attacking Obama)

What's that saying that BLM is so fond of? ACAB? 

I don't see anyone removing the ones calling for violence, or shutting down congress until they are dealt with. Until they do take a stand, they are complicit in allowing it to happen.

>He is a policitians. He is held to higher standard than rioters. Sorry you don't understand that.

*Technically* he is a citizen, and held to the same standard as the rest of us.

*Realistically* he is part of the upper class (wealthy/politicians/corporations/etc.) and isn't held to a standard at all. Whether you consider that ""held to a higher standard"" I guess is your opinion (just not a very accurate one).

>Then you will want to focus more on right wing groups who definitely commit a shitload of crimes against children.

Source needed.

>And why do you seem so focused on children specifically hen it is completely irrelevant to the point?

The Rittenhouse case (the one where violent pedophiles/felons belonging to left-leaning groups attacked a child and were killed/injured by his self-defense with a firearm) is the most recent incident I can recall following the original statement. Whereas people are calling out the politician for ""maybe possibly probably but not directly"" calling for violence, those left-leaning folks are *actually* out in the streets committing violent acts.

Rittenhouse was a child at the time (I'd say he still is at 18, but that's me), hence the focus on those left-leaning folks attacking children without provocation...because that's what they did.

>Really that's not the first time, I have met people like you and you guys keep speaking about assault on children when the subject has nothing to do with that. What's up with that?

I mean I figured it was obvious, a case where a child was assaulted by mobs of left-leaning folks, resulted in a comment about a child being attacked. Perhaps if this is a recurring thing for you, you might look into what the common thread is there (Hint: it's you).


>Kyle Rittenhouse is off topic. We are not talking about him right now. This is not hard to understand. 

...You're kidding me right? You might want to scroll up a bit here and re-read the OP. I'll copy/paste the title here for you: 

""Cawthorn praises ***Rittenhouse verdict***, tells supporters: ‘Be armed, be dangerous.’""

Bolding/emphasis mine.

Rittenhouse is explicitly *not* off-topic, because his court case/verdict *is* the topic.

>We are talking about left vs right political violence and how it pertains to what Cawthorn said.

Apparently we are not, because while I am discussing left vs right political violence and what Cawthorn said, you are arguing...well I'm not sure *what* you're arguing if you aren't talking about the OP (Cawthorn's statements and the Rittenhouse verdict).

>Again you seem to have trouble understanding, this post is about political violence in general and Cawthorne statement's specifically. KR's story is irrelevant appart from the fact that it prompted Cawthorne to make his statement.

The Rittenhouse verdict is quite literally not irrelevant, considering it is one of the most recent instances of political violence (and as you stated was the cause of Cawthorn's statements to begin with.)

>What you don't understand is that KR story's details is not relevant because it's just annecdotal, statistics are what matters.

Statistics that you have as of yet, not posted/linked. I'm still waiting for the statistical comparison between violent crimes and the Left/Right.

>That and the fact that Cawthorne is inciting violence.

So *[charge him](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/373#)*.

Keep in mind that the full transcript of the video will likely be shown in court, so you'll have to somehow prove that the below statement was somehow *not* a confirmation that you have a right to defend yourself, and was somehow instead a call to some sort of violent action.

“Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty, my friends. ***You have a right to defend yourselves. Be armed, be dangerous and be moral.***”

>As I said it's a wrongful statement. Here are the sources:

>https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/20494

>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/white-supremacists-rightwing-domestic-terror-2020

>https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf

>Happy now?

These are great sources...for a discussion limited specifically to terrorism. As you stated above:

>We are talking about left vs right political violence and how it pertains to what Cawthorn said.

I don't see anything in there that states we are specifically talking about *terrorism*, so it must be off-topic. 

>Never said that. That's a strawman fallacy.

Off topic. We're not talking about fallacies.

>I said that annecdotal evidence is no valid. So no, KR is not relevant to the point argued.

Rittenhouse is specifically relevant, because the statement in question is ***about the Rittenhouse trial/verdict***.

You want to generalize that into a discussion about overall political-related violence, I'm with you. You want to turn it into a discussion specifically about terrorism? I think it's fucking weird, but I'd probably agree with you.

...What exactly is this supposed to show? That white prisoners are slightly more likely to be Republican than Independent? That Black prisoners are overwhelmingly more likely to be Democrat than anything else?

There's no mention of the overall statistics (how many prisoners in total identify as X/Y/Z for example). Nothing in the article has any kind of indication as to the type of crimes (violent/nonviolent).

You posted this like it's some sort of 'gotcha', but I'm not even sure how this article is relevant...did you literally just see ""prisoner political views"" and not bother reading the actual text? LOL.

>Strawman. You are trying to derail the conversation by mentioning one specific case, albeit a recent one

The most recent case, which was the topic of Cawthorn's statements. Yes.

>when we are discussing political violence as a whole

Are we? Because you've been posting ""statistics"" that are just articles about worldwide terrorism and...prisoner political alignment compared to their race...for some reason.



>and how Cawthrone statement is exactly supportive of that

Yet to be shown in any way.

>KR's case details are, once again, IRRELEVANT. 

The Rittenhouse case is *the most relevant* of anything mentioned so far. It is an extremely recent case of political-related violence, ***and was the subject of Cawthorn's statement***.

>Stay on topic, ffs.

I'm struggling with whether you are simply trolling me, or if you genuinely believe you're onto something here, haha.

>Look up in this comment.

To what part, the worldwide terrorism (which does NOT include statistics on overall political-related violence), or the article breaking down which race is more likely to be Republican/Democrat amongst a small section of the prison population?

Neither seem to be terribly relevant.

>I agree with that. I am not a fan of Biden either. And he is certainly not left-wing.

He is the leader of the left-wing party in America, which (surprise!) is where Cawthorn is a politician, where the Rittenhouse trial/incident took place, and is the subject of this entire discussion.",False,t1_hlkdrd8,/r/politics/comments/qydxba/cawthorn_praises_rittenhouse_verdict_tells/hlkwptf/,"What's that saying that BLM is so fond of? ACAB?   I don't see anyone removing the ones calling for violence, or shutting down congress until they are dealt with. Until they do take a stand, they are complicit in allowing it to happen. Technically he is a citizen, and held to the same standard as the rest of us. Realistically he is part of the upper class (wealthy/politicians/corporations/etc.) and isn't held to a standard at all. Whether you consider that ""held to a higher standard"" I guess is your opinion (just not a very accurate one).   Source needed.   The Rittenhouse case (the one where violent pedophiles/felons belonging to left-leaning groups attacked a child and were killed/injured by his self-defense with a firearm) is the most recent incident I can recall following the original statement. Whereas people are calling out the politician for ""maybe possibly probably but not directly"" calling for violence, those left-leaning folks are actually out in the streets committing violent acts.  Rittenhouse was a child at the time (I'd say he still is at 18, but that's me), hence the focus on those left-leaning folks attacking children without provocation...because that's what they did.   I mean I figured it was obvious, a case where a child was assaulted by mobs of left-leaning folks, resulted in a comment about a child being attacked. Perhaps if this is a recurring thing for you, you might look into what the common thread is there (Hint: it's you).    ...You're kidding me right? You might want to scroll up a bit here and re-read the OP. I'll copy/paste the title here for you:   ""Cawthorn praises Rittenhouse verdict , tells supporters: ‘Be armed, be dangerous.’""  Bolding/emphasis mine.  Rittenhouse is explicitly not off-topic, because his court case/verdict is the topic.   Apparently we are not, because while I am discussing left vs right political violence and what Cawthorn said, you are arguing...well I'm not sure what you're arguing if you aren't talking about the OP (Cawthorn's statements and the Rittenhouse verdict).   The Rittenhouse verdict is quite literally not irrelevant, considering it is one of the most recent instances of political violence (and as you stated was the cause of Cawthorn's statements to begin with.)   Statistics that you have as of yet, not posted/linked. I'm still waiting for the statistical comparison between violent crimes and the Left/Right.   So charge him .  Keep in mind that the full transcript of the video will likely be shown in court, so you'll have to somehow prove that the below statement was somehow not a confirmation that you have a right to defend yourself, and was somehow instead a call to some sort of violent action.  “Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty, my friends. You have a right to defend yourselves. Be armed, be dangerous and be moral. ”       These are great sources...for a discussion limited specifically to terrorism. As you stated above:   I don't see anything in there that states we are specifically talking about terrorism , so it must be off-topic.    Off topic. We're not talking about fallacies.   Rittenhouse is specifically relevant, because the statement in question is about the Rittenhouse trial/verdict .  You want to generalize that into a discussion about overall political-related violence, I'm with you. You want to turn it into a discussion specifically about terrorism? I think it's fucking weird, but I'd probably agree with you.    ...What exactly is this supposed to show? That white prisoners are slightly more likely to be Republican than Independent?

Right so here's the thing: the people pursuing Kyle do not know when or if Kyle intends to turn around and unload on random people.  As long as that question is open and he's made it clear he's willing to use his weapon, it is reasonable for them to believe he is likely to do so.

> However, the problem is that by running towards Rittenhouse when he isn’t attacking you means that you are purposely running towards a threat that is currently not posing a threat.

As we've already discussed, he poses a threat as long as he has the capability to turn around and fire his gun.

That's a dubious claim.  You're projecting a state of mind that you can't reasonably assert was present.

They actually do.  You are possessed of two capabilities when under attack: you can try to escape or you can try to fight back.  If you don't believe escape is a possibility, then you have only one option.  In a chaotic situation it's not difficult to read circumstances as not providing the opportunity to escape.  There's also the motivation to protect *other people*, in which case you need some way to get everyone to safety before the gunman can shoot them or you need to attempt to disable the gunman.

This is what I mean when I say the reasoning applied to Kyle isn't being applied consistently.  When Kyle didn't feel like he could escape they deem it OK for him to shoot.  But they refuse under any circumstance to acknowledge that other people may not have felt that they could escape from who they perceived as an active shooter.

> the video apparently only had audio and didn’t show Kyle’s face, so, it might not actually have been him.

The possibility is open that it wasn't him, but that doesn't mean there isn't good reason to believe it was him.

> As for the wiping social media thing, I wouldn’t hold that against him as it is a fairly common reaction whenever something legal happens.

As long as that question is open and he's made it clear he's willing to use his weapon, it is reasonable for them to believe he is likely to do so.

Grosskreutz is alive. And Rittenhouse didn't brandish. Open carry is not brandishing.

>Do you mean: ""You can't just show up wherever you want and pretend to be an armed guard because you aren't happy with how the police are handling things.""

No. About how you said nothing dealt with a political slant. It's so very easy to read when I keep what you said in my reply and then quote you. 

>I mean I can quote everything I've said up until now but it's mostly answering your questions when you refuse to acknowledge a law that's inconvenient for your argument.  I'm not sure you remember what I've said.

>No, outside the possibility it was a straw purchase, Kyle was legally carrying that gun.  

And the man who committed that straw purchase is being charged with it...

>It was not legal for him to travel to an area he felt was so dangerous he needed to arm himself to go there despite lacking a real and present need to be there. 

You mean the place where his dad, grandma, and aunt lived? Where he worked? Where his best friend lived at? I don't think you know what ""traveling"" was for him.

>It was not legal for him to go there with a weapon to guard businesses and interfere with the emergency response.

So, you are saying that everyone else there should also fall under that category, right?

>But you do have a problem with people seeing an active shooter as a threat.

I have a problem with mob mentality. We have proof from the medical pathologist saying that Rosenbaum reached for Rittenhouse's gun due to the soot stippling compared to gun powder stippling. He was not an active shooter just because you said he was.

>Sure, when the crime being committed is not a direct cause of the harm.  However, Kyle's crime is a direct cause of the harm he did.

>Pretending to be an armed guard, doing the job you're not licensed to do poorly, and killing people because you didn't know what you were doing is clearly criminal negligence.  There's no emotion to it, it's comparable to driving a car without a license or while drunk and running someone over.

Do you believe that if a teacher rushed a school shooter that they would have a hard time claiming self defense? Because what you’re arguing is that two people who were under the impression Rittenhouse was an active shooter somehow have a greater burden than the teacher.

At the point at which Rittenhouse fired at the second and third individuals in this case, I fail to understand how anyone can argue they were not responding to him as if he was an active shooter.

Yes, there's a stain on the stove that I was wiping it off. After all, clean walls are more important than human life apparently.

> What?! Those guys attacked Kyle.

Therefore he didn't harm anyone, I understand what you're arguing. They no longer qualify as human.

Lol your analogy doesn't make any fucking sense. You can't clean a stain on a hot stove without burning yourself. You can put out a fire without getting attacked
